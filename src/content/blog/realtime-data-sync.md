In today's data-driven world, keeping information synchronized across multiple systems in real-time is crucial for business operations. This post details how we built an enterprise-scale data synchronization platform that processes over 5 million events daily with sub-100ms latency.

## Overview

This platform provides a robust, scalable solution for real-time data synchronization across multiple databases and systems. It leverages Change Data Capture (CDC) technology to track and propagate data changes with minimal latency.

The system processes millions of events daily, ensuring data consistency across distributed systems while maintaining high throughput and low latency.

## Key Features

### Change Data Capture (CDC)

Real-time capture of database changes using Debezium connectors. Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and other databases with minimal impact on source systems.

### Stream Processing

Advanced data transformation and enrichment using Apache Flink and RisingWave. Real-time aggregations, filtering, and complex event processing enable sophisticated data pipelines.

### Event Streaming

Apache Kafka backbone providing reliable, ordered message delivery with exactly-once semantics. Multi-partition support for horizontal scalability ensures the system can grow with your needs.

### High Availability

Fault-tolerant architecture with automatic failover. Distributed processing ensures continuous operation even during node failures, maintaining our 99.9% uptime SLA.

## Architecture

### Data Flow

The platform follows a clear data flow pattern:

1. **Source Databases**: Changes are captured from multiple source databases
2. **Debezium Connectors**: CDC connectors stream change events to Kafka
3. **Kafka Topics**: Events are organized into logical topics by source and type
4. **Stream Processors**: Flink/RisingWave transform and enrich the data
5. **Target Systems**: Processed data is delivered to various destinations

### Components

Our architecture consists of several key components:

- **Kafka Cluster**: 5+ node cluster with replication factor 3
- **Debezium**: Connectors for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server
- **Apache Flink**: Stream processing for complex transformations
- **RisingWave**: Streaming database for materialized views
- **Schema Registry**: Centralized schema management with Avro

## Technical Highlights

### Performance

- Processes 5M+ events per day
- Average latency < 100ms end-to-end
- 99.9% uptime SLA

### Scalability

- Horizontal scaling with Kafka partitions
- Auto-scaling based on throughput
- Support for 50+ source databases

### Reliability

- Exactly-once delivery guarantees
- Dead letter queue for failed messages
- Automated monitoring and alerting

## Use Cases

### Data Warehouse Sync

Real-time replication of operational data to data warehouses for analytics and reporting without impacting production systems. This enables business intelligence teams to work with near-real-time data.

### Microservices Integration

Event-driven architecture enabling loose coupling between microservices with guaranteed data consistency across services. Each service can subscribe to relevant data changes without direct dependencies.

### Cache Invalidation

Automatic cache updates based on database changes, ensuring cache coherency without manual invalidation logic. This dramatically simplifies application code while improving data freshness.

### Audit & Compliance

Complete audit trail of all data changes for compliance requirements. Immutable event log provides point-in-time recovery and full traceability of data modifications.

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Schema Evolution

**Problem**: Database schemas change over time, breaking downstream consumers.

**Solution**: Implemented Schema Registry with backward/forward compatibility checks. Automated schema migration and versioning ensures smooth evolution without breaking existing consumers.

### Challenge: Data Consistency

**Problem**: Ensuring exactly-once semantics across distributed systems.

**Solution**: Leveraged Kafka's idempotent producers and transactional APIs. Implemented deduplication logic with unique message keys to guarantee exactly-once processing.

### Challenge: Performance at Scale

**Problem**: Maintaining low latency with increasing data volume.

**Solution**: Optimized partition strategy, implemented batch processing where appropriate, and used RisingWave for incremental materialized views. This allows us to handle growing data volumes without sacrificing latency.

## Technology Stack

### Streaming Layer
- Apache Kafka
- Kafka Connect
- Confluent Schema Registry
- Debezium

### Processing Layer
- Confluent Kafka Go
- Apache Flink
- RisingWave

### Infrastructure
- Kubernetes
- Strimzi (Kafka on Kubernetes)
- KafbatUI (Kafka management)
- Grafana (monitoring)

## Lessons Learned

Building this platform taught us several valuable lessons:

1. **Start with the schema**: Investing in Schema Registry from day one saved countless hours of debugging and migration work.

2. **Monitor everything**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting are essential for maintaining high availability in distributed systems.

3. **Plan for failure**: Designing for failure from the beginning (dead letter queues, retry logic, circuit breakers) made the system much more resilient.

4. **Performance tuning is iterative**: Finding the right partition strategy and batch sizes required continuous monitoring and adjustment.

## Conclusion

Building an enterprise-scale real-time data synchronization platform is challenging but incredibly rewarding. By leveraging proven technologies like Kafka, Debezium, and stream processing frameworks, we created a system that handles millions of events daily while maintaining low latency and high reliability.

The key to success was focusing on reliability, scalability, and observability from the start. If you're building a similar system, invest in proper monitoring, embrace failure as a design constraint, and don't underestimate the importance of schema management.
